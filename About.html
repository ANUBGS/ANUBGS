    <p> <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/">Board Game Geek</a> (BGG) is a database of board games and much of BGG's information is given voluntarily by users. This means some information may be incorrect or misinformed (Although I haven't encountered any inaccuracies yet).

    <p>
        Some of ANU BGS's games are not listed in BGGs database and are thus excluded from all searches. These are mostly jigsaw puzzles.
